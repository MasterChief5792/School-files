The House on Maple Street:

It was a perfect liftoff. He didn't yet know where he was to go, but he sure knew he was going somewhere.

One day, a man named Jack came walking over to Mr. Sausage's house. He went inside without even ringing the doorbell!
Mr. Sausage's neighbors were thinking "That Jack figure is very suspicious..."
The next day, Mr. Sausage was gone, and so was that Jack figure. Some people thought he was a relative of his going on a fun vacation together. No one knew that he was actually a spy coming to recruit people, and Mr. Sausage was the first to be recruited.
After that, for over 2 years, the neighbors were hearing strange clanking noises from under Mr. Sausage's house. They didn't know what it was, but they heard it.
Then, a big truck dropped off weird crates to Mr. Sausage. For a year following that weird truck’s appearance, they heard the noise of explosives and saw Mr. Sausage’s house shaking like crazy.
On the next Christmas, his house shot out of the ground like a rocket… CUT!!!
NARRORATOR: Now we will switch to Mr. Sausages point of view.
START IT ROLLING!!!
He was in his bed when it happened. He was shooting up into the sky, and just like he was trained to do, he didn’t leave his bed until he was in outer space. By then, the internal oxygen supply had already turned on, and he was having some fun. Now, back when he was in his bed, he was thinking “I don’t know where I’m going to go, but I know I’m going somewhere.”


THE END!!!

(For now!!!)
